# game-alpha
A blank slate to begin brainstorming game ideas

- Pixel art
- Dungeon diving, looting, mining, gathering, combat heavy - but with a sandbox-like home space?
  * Day-night cycle
  * Inventory management system
  * Home grid system for object placement
  
- Skill development/level up
  * Combat skills
  * Farming skills?
  * Mining skills?
  * Armoring skills, cooking skills, passives, etc.
 
- Class system - can choose one from each pool:
  * **Combat class**
   + Fighter
   + Mage
   + Ranger
   + Healer
   
  * **Homestead class**
   + Crop-focused
   + Livestock-focused
   + Building-focused
   
  * **Adventure class**
   + Miner
   + Harvestor
   + Landscaper?
